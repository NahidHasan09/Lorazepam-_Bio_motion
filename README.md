# Lorazepam-_Bio_motion

This repository contains all the analysis scripts from my master's thesis project: Effect of Lorazepam on the neural representations of biological motion.
In order to make these scripts user friendly and replicable, they are being contineuously updated and transitioned to python functions.

## Summary of the study:

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of lorazepam on the neural representations of point-light displays of social interactions. 
63 healthy male participants in a randomized controlled trial received a single dose of lorazepam (1mg) or placebo. In an event-related 7T fMRI study, they watched point-light displays of different kinds of social interactions, and random motion control stimuli.
In addition to univariate analyses using standard software (SPM), I also analysed the data using a newly developed toolbox called GLMsingle, which yields reliable single-trial estimates of neural responses. 
This allowed to conduct representational similarity analysis to explore the neural representations of social interactions displayed as biological motion. 
GLMsingle yielded similar findings regarding regions responding to biological motion as an SPM analysis, an encouraging result that motivated subsequent RSA. 
Lorazepam did not affect the neural representations of the social interactions we presented to the participants. This might be due to us having used a too low dose of lorazepam. 
Future studies should thus use higher doses, and perhaps several of them, when assessing the effects of lorazepam on the neural correlates of social interactions.
